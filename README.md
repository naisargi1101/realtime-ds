**Distributed Real-Time Data Processing Project**
**Overview**
This project implements a distributed real-time data processing system using Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Prometheus, and Grafana. The system is designed to ingest, process, store, and visualize real-time data streams efficiently and scalably.

**Features**
Apache Kafka: Message broker for high-throughput data ingestion.
Apache Flink: Real-time stream processing framework.
Apache Spark: Batch processing framework for large-scale data processing.
Cassandra: Distributed NoSQL database for scalable storage.
Elasticsearch: Distributed search and analytics engine for indexing and querying.
Prometheus: Monitoring and alerting toolkit for system metrics.
Grafana: Platform for visualizing and analyzing metrics through dashboards.

**Architecture**
The architecture of the system involves:

Data Ingestion: Kafka for streaming data ingestion.
Real-time Processing: Flink for real-time analytics and processing.
Batch Processing: Spark for batch analytics and processing.
Data Storage: Cassandra for scalable and distributed data storage.
Data Indexing and Querying: Elasticsearch for indexing and querying data.
Monitoring and Visualization: Prometheus for monitoring system metrics and Grafana for visualizing metrics through dashboards.

**Installation**
Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose for managing multi-container Docker applications.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command will start all necessary services (Kafka, Flink, Spark, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Grafana) defined in docker-compose.yml.

**Access the services:**

Kafka: localhost:9092
Flink Web UI: localhost:8081
Spark Web UI: localhost:8080
Cassandra: localhost:9042
Elasticsearch: localhost:9200
Prometheus: localhost:9090
Grafana: localhost:3000 (Login with username admin and password admin)

**Usage**
Once the containers are running, you can start processing real-time and batch jobs using Flink and Spark.
Use Kafka for data ingestion and Cassandra for storing processed data.
Monitor system performance and metrics using Prometheus and visualize them through Grafana dashboards.

Distributed Real-Time Data Processing System
Description:
Designed and implemented a real-time data processing system to handle and analyze large volumes of streaming data efficiently.

Key Responsibilities:

Developed data ingestion pipelines using Apache Kafka.
Implemented real-time data processing with Apache Flink and Spark.
Integrated machine learning models for real-time analytics.
Deployed and managed the system using Docker and Kubernetes.
Technologies Used:

Languages: Python, Java, Scala
Frameworks: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Apache Spark
Databases: Cassandra, Elasticsearch
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes
Achievements:

Processed and analyzed over 1 million data events per second.
Reduced data processing latency by 40% through optimized pipeline design.
Achieved high availability and fault tolerance with Kubernetes orchestration.
Additional Details:

Worked in a cross-functional team of data engineers and data scientists.
Created detailed documentation for data pipelines and processing logic.
Conducted extensive testing to ensure data accuracy and system reliability.

Expected Output:
Kafka:

Kafka will start as a message broker.
You can access Kafka at localhost:9092 for external communication and kafka:9093 internally within Docker Compose.
Zookeeper:

Zookeeper will start as the coordination service for Kafka.
It's accessed internally within Docker Compose at zookeeper:2181.
Flink:

Flink will start as a stream processing framework.
You can access the Flink Web UI at localhost:8081.
Spark:

Spark will start as a batch processing framework.
You can access the Spark Web UI at localhost:8080.
Cassandra:

Cassandra will start as a distributed NoSQL database.
You can access Cassandra at localhost:9042.
Elasticsearch:

Elasticsearch will start as a distributed search and analytics engine.
You can access Elasticsearch at localhost:9200.
Prometheus:

Prometheus will start as a monitoring and alerting toolkit.
You can access Prometheus at localhost:9090.
Grafana:

Grafana will start as a platform for monitoring and observability.
You can access Grafana at localhost:3000 with username admin and password admin.
Usage:
Data Processing: You would typically deploy and run your data processing jobs using Flink for real-time processing and Spark for batch processing. This involves submitting jobs through their respective APIs or interfaces.

Data Storage and Query: Store data in Cassandra for distributed storage and Elasticsearch for indexing and querying.

Monitoring and Visualization: Use Prometheus to monitor the performance and health of your system, and Grafana to visualize metrics and create dashboards.

Notes:
Configuration: Ensure your Docker Compose configuration (docker-compose.yml) matches your project's specific requirements and paths to configuration files (server.properties, flink-conf.yaml, etc.).

Networking: Components like Kafka and Zookeeper are configured to communicate within Docker Compose using their service names (kafka, zookeeper). External ports are mapped to localhost for accessibility from your local machine.

Access Control: Grafana is configured with default credentials (admin/admin). For production use, configure security and access controls appropriately.

Running this setup provides you with a comprehensive environment for developing, testing, and running your distributed real-time data processing applications locally using Docker Compose. Adjust configurations and settings as necessary based on your specific application requirements and development environment.
